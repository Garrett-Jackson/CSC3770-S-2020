# CSC 3770 Spring 2020

## Computer Graphics

We will learn how to draw pretty pictures using science.

Specifically, we will use JavaScript and WebGL.

There will be projects. You will hate them. You will love them.

My current end goal is to get you to the point of being able to make a browser-based game using 3D graphics and a physics engine.

We will **not** skimp on the science.
