## Computer Graphics

We will learn how to draw pretty pictures using science.

Specifically, we will use JavaScript and WebGL 2.

There will be projects. You will hate them. You will love them.

My current end goal is to get you to the point of being able to make a browser-based game using 3D graphics and a physics engine.

We will **not** skimp on the science.

### WebGL 2

WebGL 1 is offered by default on many browswers. It may be necessary (Safari for example) to enable WebGL 2 support.

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
| --------- | ------ |
| Projects  | 100% |

Both exams are cumulative.

## What might be hard about this course

### You may be new to JavaScript

This is a great opportunity to learn the official language of *What Ever Dude - We're Cool Right?*

### Math

There is math in graphics. Lots. Of. Math.

### One false step and ...

You get a blank screen. You may have to adopt new debugging discipline.

### WebGL is all plumbing

My version of Hello World is 230 lines long. To draw one frigging triangle. 230 lines.

TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FRIGGING LINES.

### You won't know when to stop

Projects are not completely specified. A big part of Computer Graphics is Graphics. It's even in the name of the course. Graphics are pictures. Graphics is art. My specifications will tell you what to build in concept. The rest is up to you.

## About the Math

If you took Linear Algebra, great! You can explain it to me. 

Seriously, we'll cover what you need to know. Then, when you get the concepts, we have libraries to do it all for you.

### A comment about equity and inclusion

I completely subscribe and agree with the Carthage statements on equity and inclusion. See them [here](https://www.carthage.edu/equity-inclusion/mission-statement/).

### Advising and accommodations

The Carthage Advising Center offers a variety of services and accommodations to students with disabilities, based on appropriate documentation, nature of disability, and academic need. In order to initiate services, students should meet with Diane Schowalter at the start of the semester to discuss reasonable accommodation. After meeting with Diane Schowalter, students in need of accommodations should also speak with individual faculty members from whom accommodations are sought to communicate their needs and make requests in a timely manner. If a student does not request accommodation or provide documentation, the faculty member is under no obligation to provide accommodations. You may contact Diane Schowalter at ext. 5802 or via e-mail at dschowalter1@carthage.edu.

### A note about accessibility

Carthage College strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers due to your disability (including mental health, learning disorders and chronic medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options.  To establish reasonable accommodations, you also need to register with Diane Schowalter in Learning Accessibility Services (dschowalter1@carthage.edu).

### Academic Success and Health

Good health can help you achieve academic success. The Health and Counseling Center (HCC) supports students by addressing physical, mental, and emotional well-being. All services are free and confidential and are provided by experienced and licensed professionals. Services are available to all full-time, undergraduate students.
